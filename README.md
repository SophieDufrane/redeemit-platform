# RedeemIt - Your Employee Recognition Platform

## 1. **Introduction**

[RedeemIt](https://redeemit-platform.onrender.com/) is a mock employee recognition platform inspired by the solutions offered by [Workhuman](https://www.workhuman.com). It allows employees to view their points balance, browse a catalogue of gift cards, and redeem rewards. Administrators can manage the catalogue and access to employee profile (personal information, point balances…), ensuring a structured and efficient rewards process.  

Built using the **Django framework**, this project serves as a learning and portfolio exercise, demonstrating full-stack development skills in designing a functional and user-friendly web application.

## 2. **User Experience - UX**

### **2.1. Scope and Structure**

#### **Scope**    

This project focuses on two main user roles:  

- **Employees** – Can view their **points balance**, browse the **gift card catalogue**, and **redeem rewards**.  
- **Administrators** – Can **manage the gift card catalogue** and **update employee profiles and point balances** through the admin panel.  

The platform is designed to provide a **clear redemption flow** and an **efficient management system** while ensuring an **intuitive user experience**.  

#### **Structure**  

The project is structured around three key areas:  

- **User Flow** – A simple and logical process for browsing, selecting, and redeeming gift cards.  
- **Admin Management** – A straightforward interface for adding, updating, removing items, as well as accessing employee's profile and redemption records.  
- **Clean & Responsive Design** – A structured layout that ensures clarity, accessibility, and ease of use across all devices.

### **2.2. User Stories**  

The project follows a user-centric approach, ensuring a smooth and intuitive experience for both employees and administrators. To structure the development process, **user stories are grouped into EPICs**, each focusing on a key aspect of the platform, such as redemption process, administrative management, and employee access.  

#### **EPIC - User Access**  
1. **Employee Register** *(must have)*

#### **UI Design Approach**  

The platform follows a **modern, clean design** with an emphasis on usability and accessibility.  

- **Mobile-First Approach** – Optimised for all screen sizes.  
- **Workhuman-Inspired Colour Palette** – Uses corporate colours for branding consistency.  
- **Typography Choices** – Ensures readability and modern aesthetics.

---

#### **Typography & Colours**
For this project, I aimed to offer a **fresh and distinct** version of the existing platform while keeping the functionalities simple and user-friendly.    
The colour palette also draws inspiration from the tech industry and current **design trends**, creating a clean, professional, and modern aesthetic.  
The chosen typography ensures **readability** and enhances the overall user experience, while the colour scheme provides a visually appealing and accessible interface.

### **3.2. Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**

The platform follows the MVC architecture (Model-View-Controller) to maintain a structured flow: 

- **Model** – Handles database logic (e.g., `CatalogueItem`, `Cart`, `CartItem` models).  
- **View** – Renders templates like `catalogue.html` or `cart.html`.  
- **Controller** – Processes user input and manages data between models and templates.  

The **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)** below illustrates how the database models connect and interact. It provides a visual representation of the database schema, showing the **relationships between tables** and the key fields in each table. 

![ERD Diagram](images-documentation/readme_images/redemption_platform_ERD.png)


### **3.3. CRUD Functionality** 

The platform is structured around **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) principles**, ensuring efficient interaction between employees, admins, and stored data.    

| **Action** | **Admin Functionalities - Admin Panel** | **Employee Functionalities - Front End** |  
|------------|------------------|------------------|  
| **Create** | Add new gift cards to the catalogue | Create a new cart by adding items |  
| **Read**   | View and manage all gift cards | View items in cart |  
| **Update** | Modify gift card details | Adjust items quantity in cart |  
| **Delete** | Remove gift cards from the system | Remove items from cart |

#### Key Takeaways from Testing
1. **User Authentication in Tests:**  
   - A **test user** had to be logged in to pass most tests using:  
     ```
     self.client.login(username='testuser', password='testpassword')
     ```  
    Additionally, fake cart items and catalogue entries were created to simulate real interactions and ensure the tests covered expected behaviours.
   
2. **Test-Driven Development (TDD) Reflection:**  
   - Tests were written **after** features were built, rather than before, meaning it **wasn’t a strict TDD approach**.
   - This allowed for verifying existing functionality rather than driving the development process.

3. **Inconsistency Fixes During Testing:**  
   - Found and corrected an inconsistency in the **URL naming** (`redeem-cart` → `redeem_cart`).
   - This was discovered during testing and fixed across urls, views, and templates.

### **5.3. Development Challenges & Debugging Process**

During the development process, I encountered various bugs, unexpected behaviors, and technical challenges that required debugging and fixing. These issues ranged from role-based access control problems, UI inconsistencies, and database handling errors to deployment and authentication issues.  
Each bug presented an opportunity to **understand Django better, refine my implementation, and improve code structure**.  

Here a summary of Fixed Bugs & Solutions:

| **Bug** | **Issue** | **Fix** |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Issues with URLs Path logic | View existed but no URL mapping | Added missing URL pattern in `urls.py` |
| Model Not Found Error | Forgot to import model in `views.py` | Added `from .models import ModelName` at the top of `views.py` |
| Static Files Not Loading | Missing `collectstatic` after deployment | Ran `python manage.py collectstatic` |
| Cloudinary Images Not Uploading | Incorrect API key, causing upload failures | Fixed credentials in `.env` |
| UserProfile Not Automatically Created | UserProfile was missing for new users, causing errors | Added Django **signals** (`post_save` for User) to auto-create profiles |
| Form Not Submitting | CSRF token missing, causing security error | Added `{% csrf_token %}` inside the form |
| Form Validation Not Triggering | Missing `required=True` in form field | Added `required=True` to form fields |
| Login Not Redirecting | Incorrect app structure & URL configuration prevented redirects | Restructured app URLs and ensured correct `redirect()` usage in views |
| Unrestricted Access to Catalogue | Users could access `/catalogue/` without logging in | Added `@login_required` to catalogue view |
| Cart URL Conflicting with Slug Pattern | The `/cart/` path conflicted with the catalogue slug URLs | Adjusted `urlpatterns` order in `urls.py` to avoid conflicts |
| Users Could Add Same Gift Card Twice | No distinction between new vs. updated items | Updated message to display either *"Added to cart"* or *"Quantity updated"* |
| RedeemIt Button Didn’t Disable | No validation in template | Used Django template logic to disable the button when user points were insufficient |
| RedeemIt Button Didn’t Submit Form | Redeeming an item required a `POST` request but lacked a form | Wrapped RedeemIt button inside a `<form>` element for proper submission |
| Employees Saw Admin Menu | No role check in UI allowed all users to see admin options | Fixed menu condition to check `user.userprofile.role` before rendering admin links |
| Flash Messages Not Disappearing | No timeout for alerts | Added JavaScript fade-out effect after 3 seconds |
| Admin Panel User Details Missing | Couldn’t retrieve user details (first name, last name, email) in admin view | Added `get_first_name`, `get_last_name`, and `get_email` methods to UserProfile |
| Redeeming Points Shows Incorrect Balance | Points deducted but not saved properly, or redemption processed incorrectly | Ensured `user_profile.point_balance` was updated and saved `user_profile.save()` |
| Users Could Have Multiple Active Carts | Users were allowed to create multiple active carts creating conflicts | Modified `add_to_cart` and `redeem_cart` logic to ensure only **one** active cart per user |
| Redemption Items Not Saving Correctly | Redemption process failed to save selected items | Fixed by properly handling `RedemptionItem` model in `redeem_cart` view |

### **5.4. Database Migration**

During development, I realised that I had mistakenly been using a database already associated with another project, which created unintended dependencies. To ensure a clean setup, I decided to migrate to a new database. While following an online guide, I encountered several challenges that required troubleshooting.   

This section outlines the steps taken, the issues faced, and how they were resolved with the valuable guidance and patience of a **Code Institute Tutor**.

#### **Steps Followed for Database Migration**  

1. **Backup Existing Data**  
  - Exported all catalogue items into a JSON file to prevent data loss:  
    ```powershell
    python manage.py dumpdata catalogue --indent 2 > catalogue/fixtures/catalogue_items.json
    ```  

2. **Create a New Database**  
  - Set up a **new PostgreSQL database** and updated the `DATABASE_URL` in both **Heroku** and the local `.env.py` file.  

3. **Reset Migrations & Apply to New Database**  
Since the new database is empty and Django does not recognize previous migrations, we had to reset migrations:  

  - **Fake-initialise migrations:**  
    ```powershell
    python manage.py migrate --fake
    ```  
    - This marks all migrations as applied without actually executing them.  
    - It prevents Django from trying to reapply migrations that were already used in the previous database.  
    - This step ensures Django recognises models without making any unwanted changes.  

  - **Delete existing migration files (except `__init__.py`) to reset migration history:**  
    ```powershell
    Get-ChildItem -Path .\* -Include "migrations" -Recurse | Remove-Item -Recurse -Force
    ```  
    - This removes all migration files across all apps, forcing Django to recreate migrations based on the current models.    

  - **Recreate migrations and apply them to the new database:**  
    ```powershell
    python manage.py makemigrations
    python manage.py migrate
    ```  

At this point, **everything started to break**, leading to migration failures.

#### **Issue Encountered & How We Fixed It**  

**Error Message:**  

    ```
    django.db.utils.ProgrammingError: relation "django_site" does not exist 
    LINE 1: SELECT 1 AS "a" FROM "django_site" LIMIT 1
    ```  

1. **Recreate Missing Migration Files**  
  - Manually recreated the `migrations` folders and added `__init__.py` inside each app:
    ```
    catalogue/migrations/__init__.py
    home/migrations/__init__.py
    ```  

2. **Fake-Migrate All Apps**  
  - Each app was individually fake-migrated to allow Django to recognize existing models, like with these examples below:
    ```
    python manage.py migrate home --fake
    python manage.py migrate admin --fake
    python manage.py migrate catalogue --fake
    ```  

3. **Verify Migration Status**  
  - After applying the migrations, checked the current migration status with:
    ```
    python manage.py showmigrations
    ```  

4. **Final Migration Execution**  
  - Once all migrations were properly listed, executed the final migration command:
    ```
    python manage.py migrate
    ```  

5. **Create a Superuser**  
  - Since this is a fresh database, the admin account must be recreated:  
    ```powershell
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

### **5.5. Validators**

#### **CSS - HTML**

To ensure the website's **HTML** and **CSS** follow web standards and best practices, I tested the code using the **W3C validation tools**.  

The [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to check for syntax errors and compliance with HTML5 standards. The validation returned **no errors**, ensuring that the HTML code is well-structured and correctly formatted.

</br>

The website's stylesheet was tested using the [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) to verify CSS compliance. The validation report confirmed **no issues**, indicating that the styles are correctly implemented and follow CSS best practices.

#### **JavaScript**

To ensure JavaScript code quality and compliance, I tested the file using [JSHint](https://jshint.com/).  
Since I used **ES6 features** such as `const` and arrow functions (`=>`), I also updated the JSHint configuration to **support ES6** by adding `esversion: 6`.  

Results indicate that the JavaScript file maintains **low complexity and readability**, ensuring better maintainability and performance.

#### **Python**

To ensure that all Python files follow best coding practices, I used **Flake8** for linting. This tool checks for **PEP 8 compliance** like syntax errors or formatting inconsistencies across the project.  

All identified issues—mostly related to **trailing spaces and minor formatting inconsistencies**—were fixed to ensure full compliance with PEP 8.

To use flake8, I ran the command `flake8` followed by each python file, example below:
```
flake8 redemption_platform/urls.py
```

#### **Lighthouse Performance & Best Practices Testing**

To assess web performance, accessibility, and best practices, I used **Google Lighthouse**.  

- **Performance** of home page background image initially scored below **80%**, but after optimizing compression and caching, performance improved.  
- **Best Practices** score was below **60%** due to HTTP links, which I updated to HTTPS, significantly improving the score.
- **Accessibility** improvements, such as adding ARIA labels and refining header hierarchy, helped achieve a **100%** accessibility score.  

However, pages containing images stored on **Cloudinary** received a **Best Practices score of 78%** due to a a third-party cookie warning:

> "Chrome is moving towards a new experience that allows users to choose to browse without third-party cookies."

Since this is related to Cloudinary's external content delivery, I could not find a way to fully mitigate this issue without affecting functionality. Despite this, all other performance aspects, including **accessibility and loading speed**, were optimised.
